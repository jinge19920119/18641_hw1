There are two classes in total, Coin and Simulation. Coin class has two instance variables, sideUp and x. SideUp is used to show which side is faced up and x is a Random variable. It also has one business method called toss that is used to decide which face is up randomly using variable x. In the Simulation class, there is main function. I have created a Coin object to toss and two int variables to calculate the numbers of side-up or side-down. And after 20 times, all the information has been printed correctly. \

There are 5 classes in this part, ParkedCar, ParkingMeter, ParkingTicket, PoliceOfficer and TestForParking class. ParkedCar is used for create and get all the information of a car. So there are constructors as setters and get-methods as getter. ParkingMeter is used for recording the purchased minute, so there are constructors and get-methods as well. PoliceOfficer is used to create a officer object, and this object can call methods in PoliceOfficer class to examine whether it has exceeded the limit and issue a ticket if it has. In the issueTicket method, it can create a ParkingTicket object and set instance variables of it. Thus, ParkingTicket class has a method to print all the information. \
\
There is a test class in addition to them called TestForParking. I have created one ParkingCar object and four ParkingMeter objects to simulate 4 cases. And the information can be printed correctly.}
